# <div align="center"> Multi-Scale Hypergraph Meets LLMs: Aligning Large Language Models for Time Series Analysis

✨ This repository provides the official implementation of MSH-LLM that aligns large language models for time series analysis.
# 1 The framework of MSH-LLM
MSH-LLM focuses on reprogramming an embedding-visible large language model, e.g., LLaMA and GPT-2, for general time series analysis, while accounting for the multi-scale structures of natural language and time series. MSH-LLM consists four main parts: 

# 2 Prerequisites

* Python 3.8.5
* PyTorch 1.13.1
* math, sklearn, numpy, torch_geometric

# 3 Datasets && Description
